    Typically, you should not specify an order larger than 3 for DNA sequences, or larger than 2 for protein sequences. However, if your input sequences contain higher-order non-random effects that are getting in the way of motif finding, you can follow the following "rules of thumb": 
    * Use a background model at least four orders less than the shortest motifs you are looking for. So, if you want to find motifs as short as six, I wouldn't use a model higher than order two. 
    * For an accurate model of order N, you need to use a FASTA file as input to fasta-get-markov with at least 10 times 4**(N+1) DNA characters in it. So,
    
    order-3 requires 2560 characters 
    order 4 requires 10240 characters 
    order 5 requires 40960 characters 
    etc.
