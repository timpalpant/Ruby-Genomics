DEPENDENCIES:

1. Ruby 1.9.2
2. Perl 5.12 (only for calling certain external scripts)
3. GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (only for certain scripts)
4. GNUPlot (only for certain scripts)
5. SAMTools (for working with BAM files)
6. Tabix (for working with any tab-delimited files)

Most of these can be installed easily with MacPorts / package management:

sudo port install ruby19 perl5 gnuplot gsl

Many of the scripts also rely upon a standard set of Unix command-line utilites (head, tail, grep, wc, sort, cat, etc.)

All dependencies also need to be added to the $PATH.


REQUIRED GEMS:

The easiest way to get set up is to install bundler with gem:

sudo gem1.9 install bundler

Then use bundler to install the rest of the requirements:

cd Ruby-Genomics
bundle install


TESTS:

Run the tests to ensure that everything is set up correctly:

cd Ruby-Genomics
rake1.9
